# Grid Test task
Implementation of test task using React.js

### Description
Create a 50x50 grid.
Whenever you click on a cell in this grid,
1 is added to all cells in the same row
and column.
If a cell was empty, set it to 1. Every
change to a cell should cause the cell to
briefly light up yellow.
If at least 5 successive numbers in the
cells form a part of a Fibonacci
sequence, shortly light these cells up
green and then empty these cells.
